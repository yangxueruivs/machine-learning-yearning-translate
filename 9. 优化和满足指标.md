## 9 优化和满足指标 Optimizing and satisficing metrics 

还有一种合并多项指标的方法。

假设你同时关注精度和运行时间两项指标，然后你要在这三个分类器中进行选择：

单纯的把精度和运行时间结合在一起可能比较奇怪，比如：

精度 - 0.5*运行时间

你可以这么做：首先定义一个可以接受的运行时间，比如100ms以内是可以接受的。然后在你设定的这个时间范围内，最大化精度。在这个例子中，于行事件是一种“满足指标”——你的分类器必须在此指标上“足够好”，因为它最多需要100ms。 准确性是“优化指标”。

如果你正在处理N个不同的指标，例如模型的二进制文件大小（这对于移动应用程序很重要，因为用户不想下载大型应用程序），运行时间和精度，你可以考虑设置N-1标准为“满足”的指标。 即，你只需要它们满足一定的值。 然后将最后一个定义为“优化”指标。 例如，为二进制文件大小和运行时间可接受的值设置阈值，并尝试在给定这些约束的情况下优化精度。

最后一个例子，假设您正在构建一个硬件设备，该设备使用麦克风来监听用户说出特定的“唤醒词”，然后唤醒系统。 比如Amazon Echo的“Alexa”; Apple Siri的“Hey Siri”; Android的“Okay Google”; 和百度的“Hello Baidu”。 你关心的是FP(False Positive)——即在没有人说出唤醒词的情况下系统醒来的频率以及FN(False Negative)——当有人说出唤醒词时，它无法唤醒的频率。该系统性能的一个合理目标是最小化FN（优化度量），每24小时运行不超过一个误报（满足指标）。

一旦你的团队在评估指标上保持一致，他们就能更快地取得进展。

## 8 Optimizing and satisficing metrics 

Here’s another way to combine multiple evaluation metrics.

Suppose you care about both the accuracy and the running time of a learning algorithm. You need to choose from these three classifiers:

It seems unnatural to derive a single metric by putting accuracy and running time into a single formula, such as:

Accuracy - 0.5*RunningTime

Here’s what you can do instead: First, define what is an “acceptable” running time. Lets say anything that runs in 100ms is acceptable. Then, maximize accuracy, subject to your classifier meeting the running time criteria. Here, running time is a “satisficing metric”—your classifier just has to be “good enough” on this metric, in the sense that it should take at most 100ms. Accuracy is the “optimizing metric.”

If you are trading off N different criteria, such as binary file size of the model (which is important for mobile apps, since users don’t want to download large apps), running time, and accuracy, you might consider setting N-1 of the criteria as “satisficing” metrics. I.e., you simply require that they meet a certain value. Then define the final one as the “optimizing” metric. For example, set a threshold for what is acceptable for binary file size and running time, and try to optimize accuracy given those constraints.

As a final example, suppose you are building a hardware device that uses a microphone to listen for the user saying a particular “wakeword,” that then causes the system to wake up. Examples include Amazon Echo listening for “Alexa”; Apple Siri listening for “Hey Siri”; Android listening for “Okay Google”; and Baidu apps listening for “Hello Baidu.” You care about both the false positive rate—the frequency with which the system wakes up even when no one said the wakeword—as well as the false negative rate—how often it fails to wake up when someone says the wakeword. One reasonable goal for the performance of this system is to minimize the false negative rate (optimizing metric), subject to there being no more than one false positive every 24 hours of operation (satisficing metric).

Once your team is aligned on the evaluation metric to optimize, they will be able to make faster progress.
