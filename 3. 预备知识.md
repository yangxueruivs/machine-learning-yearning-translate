## 3 预备知识

如果你参加过机器学习课程比如Coursera上的机器学习MOOC(吴恩达自己之前的课程)，或者你有监督学习的经验，你就能够理解这本书的内容。

我假设你已经对监督学习比较熟了: 用打了标签的训练样本(x, y来学习一个让x映射到y的函数。监督学习的算法包括线性回归、逻辑回归和神经网络等。机器学习有多种形式，但在今天，主要的使用价值都大多来源于监督学习。

我会经常参考神经网络(AKA "深度学习")。 要学习本书，你只需要对机器学习有基本的了解就可以了。如果你对这些概念还不太理解，学习三个星期的机器学习课程(​http://ml-class.org)会很有帮助。

## 3 Prerequisites and Notation
If you have taken a Machine Learning course such as my machine learning MOOC on Coursera, or if you have experience applying supervised learning, you will be able to understand this text.

I assume you are familiar with ​supervised learning​: learning a function that maps from x to y, using labeled training examples (x,y). Supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. There are many forms of machine learning, but the majority of Machine Learning’s practical value today comes from supervised learning.

I will frequently refer to neural networks (also known as “deep learning”). You’ll only need a basic understanding of what they are to follow this text. If you are not familiar with the concepts mentioned here, watch the first three weeks of videos in the Machine Learning course on Coursera at ​http://ml-class.org
