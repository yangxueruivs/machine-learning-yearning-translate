## 2 如何使用本书来帮助你的团队

读完本书后，你会对如何为机器学习项目设定技术方向建立深刻的认识。

但是你的团队成员可能不会理解你在技术上做的选择。

也许你希望团队能够定义几种评估参数，但他们不能确信。怎样才能说服他们呢。

这就是这一章这么短的原因：

## 2 How to use this book to help your team

After finishing this book, you will have a deep understanding of how to set technical direction for a machine learning project.

But your teammates might not understand why you’re recommending a particular direction.

Perhaps you want your team to define a single-number evaluation metric, but they aren’t convinced. How do you persuade them?

That’s why I made the chapters short: So that you can print them out and get your teammates to read just the 1-2 pages you need them to know.

A few changes in prioritization can have a huge effect on your team’s productivity. By helping your team with a few such changes, I hope that you can become the superhero of your team!
